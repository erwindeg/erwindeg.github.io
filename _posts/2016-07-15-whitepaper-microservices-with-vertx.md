In this whitepaper we discuss the specific advantages of Vert.x and present an overview of the different functionalities of the framework.

## Changes in software development

According to Gartner (http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3165317), the
amount of devices connected to the internet in 2016 will be about 6.4 billion.
Users of these devices expect real-time information everywhere and anytime.
This amounts to an annual IP traffic of over 1 zettabyte (1 billion terabyte).
Handling huge amounts of (near) real-time data puts high demands on
applications and their underlying architecture. To fulfill these demands, we
need systems that are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message driven. The
reactive Manifesto (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) calls these kind of applications
Reactive Systems. These systems are message driven, work by reacting
to events and are usually realized as a microservice architecture. A combination
of these concepts makes them scalable and responsive.
In this paper we will introduce the Vert.x toolkit as a solution for building
applications that meet these changing demands by implementing the Reactive
Systems approach.
