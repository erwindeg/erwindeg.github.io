Vert.x is a polyglot event-driven application framework for the Java Virtual Machine. It aims to solve many of the challenges we face when implementing Microservice architectures. In my whitepaper ‘Simplify your Microservices implementation with Vert.x’ I discuss the specific advantages of Vert.x and give an overview of the different functionalities of the framework.
