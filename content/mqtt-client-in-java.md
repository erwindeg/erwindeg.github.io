### What is MQTT?
MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol on top of TCP/IP. Its lightweight properties make it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) scenario's,
where battery, cpu and memory resources are often limited. However the protocol can also be used on more powerful devices. MQTT requires low bandwidth and has facilities for unreliable networks.
